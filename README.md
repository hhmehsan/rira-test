# rira-test

<!-- This is a test project for Rira company.
I use git for source code management to handle project better.
using vue cdn because it's small project and that's enough.
I have a data, called counter for showing number of clicking on the button and a method called increaseCounter.
of course we can use this method in html directly .
v-cloak is a directive used to hide content until compilation is finished. Typically, v-cloak prevents the user from seeing flickering of pre-compiled content including curly braces during the loading of the page. -->
